    "**Important Notes**:\n",
    "1. Be sure to **document** all of your decisions, as well as your intermediate and final results. Make sure your conclusions and analyses are clearly presented. Don't make us dig into your code or walls of printed results to try to draw conclusions from your code.\n",
    "2. If you use code from someone else (e.g. Github, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, etc) you **must be transparent about it**. Document your sources and explain how you adapted any partial solutions to creat **your** solution.\n",

    "We will do this in steps using a Multilayer Perceptron on MNIST.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ I have provided some **starter** code at the beginning. **NONE** of this code should survive in your solutions. Not only is it **very** badly written, it is also written in my functional style that also obfuscates what it's doing (in part to **discourage** your reuse!). It's just to get you *started*.\n",
    "+ These exercises ask you to compare **multiple** training runs, so it is **really** important that you factor this into your **pipeline**. Using [Tensorboard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html) is a **very** good idea -- or, even better [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).\n",

    "Classic MLP (without skip connections):\n",
    "In the gradient plots, a typical phenomenon of deep networks can be observed: the gradient norms decrease rapidly in the deeper layers, close to the input. This is caused by the vanishing gradient problem, where the error signal backpropagating through the network becomes progressively attenuated. As a result, the early layers receive very small gradients, update their weights slowly, and contribute little to learning. This explains why a classic MLP takes longer to converge and may get stuck at relatively low performance.    \n",
    "\n",
    "MLP with skip connections:\n",
    "Adding bypass connections between layers allows gradients to skip certain layers and reach deeper layers more easily. In the gradnorm plots, it can be observed that the gradients remain more balanced across all layers, including the deeper ones. This enables the early layers to update more effectively, improving training stability and accelerating convergence. In fact, skip connections mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, making the learning of deep layers more efficient."
