This repo contains three exercise of Deep Learning Applications, and a presentation of conference paper in Reinforcement Learning.
The tree exercise is:
-Homework 1: CNN
-Homework 2: DRL
-Homework 3: Transformer

The paper for the presentations is "1000 Layer Networks for Self-Supervised RL: Scaling
Depth Can Enable New Goal-Reaching Capabilities"
