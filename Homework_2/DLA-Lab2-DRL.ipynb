    "In this laboratory session we will work on getting more advanced versions of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms up and running. Deep Reinforcement Learning is **hard**, and getting agents to stably train can be frustrating and requires quite a bit of subtlety in analysis of intermediate results. We will start by refactoring (a bit) my implementation of `REINFORCE` on the [Cartpole environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/). "

    "### Exercise 3.1: Solving Lunar Lander with `REINFORCE` (easy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use my (or even better, improve on my) implementation of `REINFORCE` to solve the [Lunar Lander Environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/). This environment is a little bit harder than Cartpole, but not much. Make sure you perform the same types of analyses we did during the lab session to quantify and qualify the performance of your agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3.2: Solving Cartpole and Lunar Lander with `Deep Q-Learning` (harder)\n",
    "\n",
    "On policy Deep Reinforcement Learning tends to be **very unstable**. Write an implementation (or adapt an existing one) of `Deep Q-Learning` to solve our two environments (Cartpole and Lunar Lander). To do this you will need to implement a **Replay Buffer** and use a second, slow-moving **target Q-Network** to stabilize learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3.3: Solving the OpenAI CarRacing environment (hardest) \n",
    "\n",
    "Use `Deep Q-Learning` -- or even better, an off-the-shelf implementation of **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** -- to train an agent to solve the [OpenAI CarRacing](https://github.com/andywu0913/OpenAI-GYM-CarRacing-DQN) environment. This will be the most *fun*, but also the most *difficult*. Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you use the `continuous=False` argument to the environment constructor. This ensures that the action space is **discrete** (we haven't seen how to work with continuous action spaces).\n",
    "2. Your Q-Network will need to be a CNN. A simple one should do, with two convolutional + maxpool layers, folowed by a two dense layers. You will **definitely** want to use a GPU to train your agents.\n",
    "3. The observation space of the environment is a single **color image** (a single frame of the game). Most implementations stack multiple frames (e.g. 3) after converting them to grayscale images as an observation.\n",
